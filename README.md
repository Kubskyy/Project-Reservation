## What I Learned

During the development of the Project Reservation System, I gained extensive hands-on experience with Spring Boot, enhancing my understanding of building robust and scalable backend systems. I deepened my knowledge of database management by working with PostgreSQL, learning how to configure and optimize this database for different environments. Utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, I developed a well-structured application that separates concerns effectively. I also improved my front-end development skills using Thymeleaf, HTML and Tailwind allowing me to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, I honed my problem-solving abilities, learned how to integrate various technologies, and practiced effective project management and collaboration techniques.
